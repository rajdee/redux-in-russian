# Troubleshooting

This is a place to share common problems and solutions to them.  
The examples use React, but you should still find them useful if you use something else.

### Nothing happens when I dispatch an action

Sometimes, you are trying to dispatch an action, but your view does not update. Why does this happen? There may be several reasons for this.

#### Never mutate reducer arguments

It is tempting to modify the `state` or `action` passed to you by Redux. Don’t do this!

Redux assumes that you never mutate the objects it gives to you in the reducer. **Every single time, you must return the new state object.** Even if you don’t use a library like [Immutable](https://facebook.github.io/immutable-js/), you need to completely avoid mutation.

Immutability is what lets [react-redux](https://github.com/gaearon/react-redux) efficiently subscribe to fine-grained updates of your state. It also enables great developer experience features such as time travel with [redux-devtools](http://github.com/gaearon/redux-devtools).

For example, a reducer like this is wrong because it mutates the state:

```js
function todos(state = [], action) {
  switch (action.type) {
  case 'ADD_TODO':
    // Wrong! This mutates state.actions.
    state.actions.push({
      text: action.text,
      completed: false
    });
  case 'COMPLETE_TODO':
    // Wrong! This mutates state.actions[action.index].
    state.actions[action.index].completed = true;
  }

  return state
}
```

It needs to be rewritten like this:

```js
function todos(state = [], action) {
  switch (action.type) {
  case 'ADD_TODO':
    // Return a new array
    return [...state, {
      text: action.text,
      completed: false
    }];
  case 'COMPLETE_TODO':
    // Return a new array
    return [
      ...state.slice(0, action.index),
      // Copy the object before mutating
      Object.assign({}, state[action.index], {
        completed: true
      }),
      ...state.slice(action.index + 1)
    ];
  default:
    return state;
  }
}
```

It’s more code, but it’s exactly what makes Redux predictable and efficient. If you want to have less code, you can use a helper like [`React.addons.update`](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/update.html) to write immutable transformations with a terse syntax:

```js
// Before:
return [
  ...state.slice(0, action.index),
  Object.assign({}, state[action.index], {
    completed: true
  }),
  ...state.slice(action.index + 1)
]

// After
return update(state, {
  [action.index]: {
    completed: {
      $set: true
    }
  }
});
```

Finally, to update objects, you’ll need something like `_.extend` from Underscore, or better, an [`Object.assign`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/assign) polyfill.

Make sure that you use `Object.assign` correctly. For example, instead of returning something like `Object.assign(state, newData)` from your reducers, return `Object.assign({}, state, newData)`. This way you don’t override the previous `state`.

You can also enable [ES7 object spread proposal](https://github.com/sebmarkbage/ecmascript-rest-spread) with [Babel stage 1](http://babeljs.io/docs/usage/experimental/):

```js
// Before:
return [
  ...state.slice(0, action.index),
  Object.assign({}, state[action.index], {
    completed: true
  }),
  ...state.slice(action.index + 1)
]

// After:
return [
  ...state.slice(0, action.index),
  { ...state[action.index], completed: true },
  ...state.slice(action.index + 1)
]
```

Note that experimental language features are subject to change, and it’s unwise to rely on them in large codebases.

#### Don’t forget to call [`dispatch(action)`](api/Store.md#dispatch)

If you define an action creator, calling it will *not* automatically dispatch the action. For example, this code will do nothing:


#### `TodoActions.js`

```js
export function addTodo(text) {
  return { type: 'ADD_TODO', text };
}
```

#### `AddTodo.js`

```js
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import { addTodo } from './TodoActions';

class AddTodo extends Component {
  handleClick() {
    // Won't work!
    addTodo('Fix the issue');
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <button onClick={() => this.handleClick()}>
        Add
      </button>
    );
  }
}
```

It doesn’t work because your action creator is just a function that *returns* an action. It is up to you to actually dispatch it. We can’t bind your action creators to a particular Store instance during the definition because apps that render on the server need a separate Redux store for every request.

The fix is to call [`dispatch()`](api/Store.md#dispatch) method on the [store](api/Store.md) instance:

```js
handleClick() {
  // Works! (but you need to grab store somehow)
  store.dispatch(addTodo('Fix the issue'));
}
```

If you’re somewhere deep in the component hierarchy, it is cumbersome to pass the store down manually. This is why [react-redux](https://github.com/gaearon/react-redux) lets you use a `connect` [higher-order component](https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/mixins-are-dead-long-live-higher-order-components-94a0d2f9e750) that will, apart from subscribing you to a Redux store, inject `dispatch` into your component’s props.

The fixed code looks like this:
#### `AddTodo.js`
```js
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import { connect } from 'react-redux';
import { addTodo } from './TodoActions';

class AddTodo extends Component {
  handleClick() {
    // Works!
    this.props.dispatch(addTodo('Fix the issue'));
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <button onClick={() => this.handleClick()}>
        Add
      </button>
    );
  }
}

// In addition to the state, `connect` puts `dispatch` in our props.
export default connect()(AddTodo);
```

You can then pass `dispatch` down to other components manually, if you want to.

## Something else doesn’t work

Ask around on the **#redux** [Reactiflux](http://reactiflux.com/) Slack channel, or [create an issue](https://github.com/reactjs/redux/issues).
